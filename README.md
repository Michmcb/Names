# Names
A small library I use personally to help categorize files and directories with attributes. Useful when you need to attach metadata to files/directories but don't want an extra file. Instead you can embed the metadata directly into the filename.

## Name
A Name only contains a title, attributes, and suffix. Useful if you just need to add some metadata to a file.

## PartName
A PartName combines up to 3 integers, a title, attributes, and suffix. This can be used to sequentially name episodes of Better Off Ted, as an example.
